WORK EXPERIENCE 
Machine Learning Engineer 
Remote 
EUAI Education 
Jun. 2024 – Dec. 2024 
 
Developed an AI-powered teaching platform for partner universities in East Asia, integrating AI modules to support professors 
in teaching and enhance students' learning in finance and accounting. 
 
Led the design and implementation of multiple chat generation pipelines using the GraphRAG technique, integrating the 
company's knowledge base with Azure cloud services, including AI Search Service, Blob Storage, and AI Studio. 
 
Developed RESTful APIs for the AI modules using Flask, successfully hosting the solution on an AWS cloud server for 
production use. Due to the independence and versatility of this functionality, the company decided to encapsulate the APIs as 
a standalone PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) product, enabling broader application and potential for additional revenue streams.

Need Satisfier Extraction Network                   
Sept. 2023 – Apr. 2024 
 
Participated in the research project to develop a novel neural network, SNM-I, which aimed to extract “need satisfiers” from 
service or program descriptions provided by various agencies and institutions. 
 
Researched and formulated a parallel structured NLP pipeline, comprising an extractive pipeline to identify potential need 
satisfiers and a generative pipeline to understand the sematic meaning and uncover hidden need satisfiers. 
 
Formulated procedural guidelines and ontology-based reasoning for the generative model, instructing the pipeline to identify 
characteristic changes introduced by the service. 
 
Conducted fine-tuning on pre-trained large language models, including RoBERTa-large, Liama 2, and GPT-3.5 turbo, 
to optimize performance. Executed comprehensive efficiency and accuracy analyses to assess model effectiveness.
