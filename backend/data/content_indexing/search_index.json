Cover and Thomas, Problem 9.9. Vector Gaussian channel.\n3. Cover and Thomas, Problem 9.12. Time-varying channel.\n4. Cover and Thomas, Problem 9.17. Impulse power.\n5. Pulse Position Modulation (PPM): In the previous problem, you \ufb01nd that the impulse\nscheme is suboptimal. In this problem, we show that if you are allowed to choose where\nto place the impulse (among the time indices i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n), this PPM scheme is capacity\nachieving on n uses of the Gaussian channel Yi = Xi + Zi at low SNR.\n(a) Let Z1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Zn be i.i.d. Gaussian random variables N(0, \u03c32). Let U = maxi{Zi}. Let\nt > 0. Justify each of the following steps:\nexp(tE[U]) \u2264E[exp(tU)] = E max\ni {exp(tZi)} \u2264\nn\nX\ni=1\nE[exp(tZi)] = n exp(t2\u03c32/2).\nYou may recognize the moment generating function of Gaussian random variable in\nthe last step.\n(b) Rewrite E[U] \u2264ln n\nt + t\u03c32\n2 . Minimize over t to arrive at the inequality\nE[U] \u2264\u03c3\np\n2 ln(n).\n(c) Use the Cherno\ufb00bound to show that for all a > 0\nProb{U \u2265\u03c3(\n\u221a\n2 ln n + a)} \u2264exp(\u2212a2/2).\n(d) In PPM, information is encoded in the position of the pulse.\nOver n uses of the\nGaussian channel, we set Xi =\n\u221a\nnP for one of i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n, and zero elsewhere.\nPlease express the information rate R of PPM per channel use in nats, assuming that\nthere is no detection error.\n(e) Please argue that it is possible to choose a constant L that depends on some (arbi-\ntrarily small) Pe target, and then by setting\n\u221a\nnP = \u03c3(\n\u221a\n2 ln n + L)\nwe can achieve a bounded target probability of detection error (e.g. Pe = 10\u22126).\n1\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n(f) Consider the low SNR regime, i.e.,\nP\n\u03c32 \u226a1. Please write down an approximation of\nthe Gaussian channel capacity in the low SNR limit, call it C. Show that for the\nachievable rate R of PPM under Pe, we have\nC < R(1 + \u03b4)\nfor some \u03b4 that goes to zero as SNR goes to zero. Hence, PPM is capacity approaching\nat low SNR.\n6. Achievable Rate of Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM): Please generate the following plots\nin a graph with SNR (in dB) on the x-axis and achievable rates on the y-axis.\n\u2022 Gaussian channel capacity C = 1\n2 log(1 + SNR).\n\u2022 The capacity of a 2-PAM input additive Gaussian noise channel as a function of SNR.\n\u2022 Repeat for 4-PAM, 8-PAM and 16-PAM, assuming uniform distribution on the input.\nWhich constellation(s) are optimum at low SNR? At high SNR, please numerically \ufb01nd the\nvalue of shaping loss (in dB), de\ufb01ned as the amount of extra power needed to achieve the\nsame rate as the Shannon capacity limit.\nPlease provide the derivations of the mutual information expressions for numerical evalu-\nation and the code for generating the plot.\n7. Shaping Loss: In this problem we will \ufb01nd the theoretical limit of shaping loss of PAM at\nhigh SNR. Consider the following two input distributions over n uses of the additive white\nGaussian noise channel Yi = Xi + Zi, where Xi is subject to power constraint P:\n\u2022 X(1)\ni\n\u223cN(0, P) i.i.d.\n\u2022 X(2)\ni\n\u223cUnif[\u2212L, L] i.i.d.\nWe write the mutual information I(X; Y ) = h(Y ) \u2212h(Y |X), where h(Y |X) = h(Z) is the\nsame in both cases, and approximate h(Y ) \u2248h(X) in high SNR.\n(a) What is the relationship between P and L for which we have h(X(1)) = h(X(2))?\n(b) Find the amount of extra power needed for X(2) in order to achieve the same mutual\ninformation as X(1). The amount of extra power is a multiplicative factor which can be\nfound analytically. Please \ufb01nd this analytic expression. Please also \ufb01nd its numerical\nvalue in dB.\n(c) Compare the theoretical shaping loss with the numerical value found in the previous\nproblem.\n8. Phase Shift Keying on Complex AWGN Channel: Suppose that we use a phase-shift keying\n(PSK) modulation on a complex additive white Gaussian noise channel where the i.i.d.\nnoises in the real and imaginary components both have a variance of\n\u03c32\n2 .\nAn M-PSK\n2\n\n=== Page 3 ===\nmodulation has M constellation points equally spaced on a circle of radius\n\u221a\nP from the\norigin, where P is the power of the constellation. Suppose that we wish to achieve a symbol\nprobability of error of 10\u22126.\nPlease derive an expression of the achievable rate of PSK signalling as a function of the\nSNR, de\ufb01ned as P/\u03c32. (You may approximate the distance between two neighbouring\nconstellation points on a circle of radius r as 2\u03c0r/M.)\nAt high SNR, does the achievable rate of the PSK constellation have the same SNR scaling\nas the capacity of the complex AWGN channel?\n3\n",

In this problem, we show that if you are allowed to choose where\nto place the impulse (among the time indices i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n), this PPM scheme is capacity\nachieving on n uses of the Gaussian channel Yi = Xi + Zi at low SNR.\n(a) Let Z1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Zn be i.i.d. Gaussian random variables N(0, \u03c32). Let U = maxi{Zi}. Let\nt > 0. Justify each of the following steps:\nexp(tE[U]) \u2264E[exp(tU)] = E max\ni {exp(tZi)} \u2264\nn\nX\ni=1\nE[exp(tZi)] = n exp(t2\u03c32/2).\nYou may recognize the moment generating function of Gaussian random variable in\nthe last step.\n(b) Rewrite E[U] \u2264ln n\nt + t\u03c32\n2 . Minimize over t to arrive at the inequality\nE[U] \u2264\u03c3\np\n2 ln(n).\n(c) Use the Cherno\ufb00bound to show that for all a > 0\nProb{U \u2265\u03c3(\n\u221a\n2 ln n + a)} \u2264exp(\u2212a2/2).\n(d) In PPM, information is encoded in the position of the pulse.\nOver n uses of the\nGaussian channel, we set Xi =\n\u221a\nnP for one of i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n, and zero elsewhere.\nPlease express the information rate R of PPM per channel use in nats, assuming that\nthere is no detection error.\n(e) Please argue that it is possible to choose a constant L that depends on some (arbi-\ntrarily small) Pe target, and then by setting\n\u221a\nnP = \u03c3(\n\u221a\n2 ln n + L)\nwe can achieve a bounded target probability of detection error (e.g. Pe = 10\u22126).\n1\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n(f) Consider the low SNR regime, i.e.,\nP\n\u03c32 \u226a1. Please write down an approximation of\nthe Gaussian channel capacity in the low SNR limit, call it C. Show that for the\nachievable rate R of PPM under Pe, we have\nC < R(1 + \u03b4)\nfor some \u03b4 that goes to zero as SNR goes to zero. Hence, PPM is capacity approaching\nat low SNR.\n6. Achievable Rate of Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM): Please generate the following plots\nin a graph with SNR (in dB) on the x-axis and achievable rates on the y-axis.\n\u2022 Gaussian channel capacity C = 1\n2 log(1 + SNR).\n\u2022 The capacity of a 2-PAM input additive Gaussian noise channel as a function of SNR.\n\u2022 Repeat for 4-PAM, 8-PAM and 16-PAM, assuming uniform distribution on the input.\nWhich constellation(s) are optimum at low SNR? At high SNR, please numerically \ufb01nd the\nvalue of shaping loss (in dB), de\ufb01ned as the amount of extra power needed to achieve the\nsame rate as the Shannon capacity limit.\nPlease provide the derivations of the mutual information expressions for numerical evalu-\nation and the code for generating the plot.\n7. Shaping Loss: In this problem we will \ufb01nd the theoretical limit of shaping loss of PAM at\nhigh SNR. Consider the following two input distributions over n uses of the additive white\nGaussian noise channel Yi = Xi + Zi, where Xi is subject to power constraint P:\n\u2022 X(1)\ni\n\u223cN(0, P) i.i.d.\n\u2022 X(2)\ni\n\u223cUnif[\u2212L, L] i.i.d.\nWe write the mutual information I(X; Y ) = h(Y ) \u2212h(Y |X), where h(Y |X) = h(Z) is the\nsame in both cases, and approximate h(Y ) \u2248h(X) in high SNR.\n(a) What is the relationship between P and L for which we have h(X(1)) = h(X(2))?\n(b) Find the amount of extra power needed for X(2) in order to achieve the same mutual\ninformation as X(1). The amount of extra power is a multiplicative factor which can be\nfound analytically. Please \ufb01nd this analytic expression. Please also \ufb01nd its numerical\nvalue in dB.\n(c) Compare the theoretical shaping loss with the numerical value found in the previous\nproblem.\n8. Phase Shift Keying on Complex AWGN Channel: Suppose that we use a phase-shift keying\n(PSK) modulation on a complex additive white Gaussian noise channel where the i.i.d.\nnoises in the real and imaginary components both have a variance of\n\u03c32\n2 .\nAn M-PSK\n2\n\n=== Page 3 ===\nmodulation has M constellation points equally spaced on a circle of radius\n\u221a\nP from the\norigin, where P is the power of the constellation. Suppose that we wish to achieve a symbol\nprobability of error of 10\u22126.\nPlease derive an expression of the achievable rate of PSK signalling as a function of the\nSNR, de\ufb01ned as P/\u03c32. (You may approximate the distance between two neighbouring\nconstellation points on a circle of radius r as 2\u03c0r/M.)\nAt high SNR, does the achievable rate of the PSK constellation have the same SNR scaling\nas the capacity of the complex AWGN channel?\n3\n",

Cover and Thomas, Problem 9.9. Vector Gaussian channel.\n3. Cover and Thomas, Problem 9.12. Time-varying channel.\n4. Cover and Thomas, Problem 9.17. Impulse power.\n5. Pulse Position Modulation (PPM): In the previous problem, you \ufb01nd that the impulse\nscheme is suboptimal. In this problem, we show that if you are allowed to choose where\nto place the impulse (among the time indices i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n), this PPM scheme is capacity\nachieving on n uses of the Gaussian channel Yi = Xi + Zi at low SNR.\n(a) Let Z1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Zn be i.i.d. Gaussian random variables N(0, \u03c32). Let U = maxi{Zi}. Let\nt > 0. Justify each of the following steps:\nexp(tE[U]) \u2264E[exp(tU)] = E max\ni {exp(tZi)} \u2264\nn\nX\ni=1\nE[exp(tZi)] = n exp(t2\u03c32/2).\nYou may recognize the moment generating function of Gaussian random variable in\nthe last step.\n(b) Rewrite E[U] \u2264ln n\nt + t\u03c32\n2 . Minimize over t to arrive at the inequality\nE[U] \u2264\u03c3\np\n2 ln(n).\n(c) Use the Cherno\ufb00bound to show that for all a > 0\nProb{U \u2265\u03c3(\n\u221a\n2 ln n + a)} \u2264exp(\u2212a2/2).\n(d) In PPM, information is encoded in the position of the pulse.\nOver n uses of the\nGaussian channel, we set Xi =\n\u221a\nnP for one of i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n, and zero elsewhere.\nPlease express the information rate R of PPM per channel use in nats, assuming that\nthere is no detection error.\n(e) Please argue that it is possible to choose a constant L that depends on some (arbi-\ntrarily small) Pe target, and then by setting\n\u221a\nnP = \u03c3(\n\u221a\n2 ln n + L)\nwe can achieve a bounded target probability of detection error (e.g. Pe = 10\u22126).\n1\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n(f) Consider the low SNR regime, i.e.,\nP\n\u03c32 \u226a1. Please write down an approximation of\nthe Gaussian channel capacity in the low SNR limit, call it C. Show that for the\nachievable rate R of PPM under Pe, we have\nC < R(1 + \u03b4)\nfor some \u03b4 that goes to zero as SNR goes to zero. Hence, PPM is capacity approaching\nat low SNR.\n6. Achievable Rate of Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM): Please generate the following plots\nin a graph with SNR (in dB) on the x-axis and achievable rates on the y-axis.\n\u2022 Gaussian channel capacity C = 1\n2 log(1 + SNR).\n\u2022 The capacity of a 2-PAM input additive Gaussian noise channel as a function of SNR.\n\u2022 Repeat for 4-PAM, 8-PAM and 16-PAM, assuming uniform distribution on the input.\nWhich constellation(s) are optimum at low SNR? At high SNR, please numerically \ufb01nd the\nvalue of shaping loss (in dB), de\ufb01ned as the amount of extra power needed to achieve the\nsame rate as the Shannon capacity limit.\nPlease provide the derivations of the mutual information expressions for numerical evalu-\nation and the code for generating the plot.\n7. Shaping Loss: In this problem we will \ufb01nd the theoretical limit of shaping loss of PAM at\nhigh SNR. Consider the following two input distributions over n uses of the additive white\nGaussian noise channel Yi = Xi + Zi, where Xi is subject to power constraint P:\n\u2022 X(1)\ni\n\u223cN(0, P) i.i.d.\n\u2022 X(2)\ni\n\u223cUnif[\u2212L, L] i.i.d.\nWe write the mutual information I(X; Y ) = h(Y ) \u2212h(Y |X), where h(Y |X) = h(Z) is the\nsame in both cases, and approximate h(Y ) \u2248h(X) in high SNR.\n(a) What is the relationship between P and L for which we have h(X(1)) = h(X(2))?\n(b) Find the amount of extra power needed for X(2) in order to achieve the same mutual\ninformation as X(1). The amount of extra power is a multiplicative factor which can be\nfound analytically. Please \ufb01nd this analytic expression. Please also \ufb01nd its numerical\nvalue in dB.\n(c) Compare the theoretical shaping loss with the numerical value found in the previous\nproblem.\n8. Phase Shift Keying on Complex AWGN Channel: Suppose that we use a phase-shift keying\n(PSK) modulation on a complex additive white Gaussian noise channel where the i.i.d.\nnoises in the real and imaginary components both have a variance of\n\u03c32\n2 .\nAn M-PSK\n2\n\n=== Page 3 ===\nmodulation has M constellation points equally spaced on a circle of radius\n\u221a\nP from the\norigin, where P is the power of the constellation. Suppose that we wish to achieve a symbol\nprobability of error of 10\u22126.\nPlease derive an expression of the achievable rate of PSK signalling as a function of the\nSNR, de\ufb01ned as P/\u03c32. (You may approximate the distance between two neighbouring\nconstellation points on a circle of radius r as 2\u03c0r/M.)\nAt high SNR, does the achievable rate of the PSK constellation have the same SNR scaling\nas the capacity of the complex AWGN channel?\n3\n",
